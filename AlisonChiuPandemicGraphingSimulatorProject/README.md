==================
## What this project does
Users can give the project the unit of time, name, data, etc. of a pandemic, and the program will take the information given, and produce a graph for the user (including the ability to view points at different parts of the graph).
## Why this project is useful
This project aims to aid people who need to understand data in a visual way. It helps people overall understand and visualize a pandemic overall.
## How I built this 
I used Qoom to create the HTML, CSS, And
## Accomplishments that I'm are proud of 
I haven't used HTML, CSS, or Javascript for almost 3 years, so just being able to come up with a product for the OneHacks hackathon was a feat in of itself! I also ran into an unspeakable amount of bugs, so it also took a very long time to debug all of them. Lastly, there were logic/structure issues which how I orignally planned out my code, so I was really happy when I fixed them.
## What is next for this project
I really want to continue to develop the simulator to include more features because I feel that it could really become more useful in the future, especially in classrooms, where students need a simplistic visual respentation on what's happening around them. I can't wait to continue on making it better!
